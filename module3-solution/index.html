              Before we say goodbye, let go But I’m lost in the maze of my
              heart. From stereo to mono. That’s how the path splits. If my fate
              is to disappear like this, then this is my last letter Penned
              words, written then erased Feelings for you, so many to let go.
              Unpuzzle my lego At a level where it can’t return to its original
              shape So be it don’t cry I’mma let you go and fly Hectic days,
              keeping myself busy Distraction filled schedule But I won’t forget
              Burned into the back of my mind like tattoo We can’t return to
              those days If I could, I’d call your name No… but I’ll accept your
              blame It really is time to say goodbye Before we say goodbye, let
              go But I’m lost in the maze of my heart From stereo to mono That’s
              how the path splits It continues In order to release your hand
              right now I gotta let you know that I need to let you go Hard to
              say goodbye But I can’t run I’m ready to let go I’m ready to let
              go I’m ready to let go What have you been up to lately? Who are
              you thinking of so far away? Life without you is really
              unbelievable But even so I still gotta go To the person I loved
              too much To the red thread that got too entangled in itself I
              couldn't reach you, so I'll walk a separate path For that reason
              I’ll say goodbye At first every day is like that Beyond the tears
              hidden in the rain I’ll wait for you, let’s start over So that in
              the future I can meet you again with a smile In order to release
              your hand right now I gotta let you know that I need to let you go
              Hard to say goodbye But I can’t run I’m ready to let go I’m ready
              to let go I’m ready to let go The color of the sky we saw together
              The scent of the path we walked down together Don’t forget them In
              order to release your hand right now I gotta let you know that I
              need to let you go Hard to say goodbye But I can’t run I’m ready
